# HTML

HTML stands for hyper text markup language.

HTML is a markup language that can used to create webpage / document.

HTML tag is basically a basic building block of any web page.

### Inline Vs Block Elements

Inline elements do not start with new line. Take only the necessary width.

eg:- span, img, a etc

Block elements start with new line. Take the full width.

eg:- div, h1 - h6, p, form etc

### Semantic Tag

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

eg:- header, footer, aside, main, artice, nav, section, details etc
